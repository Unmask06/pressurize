# Overview — What Pressurize Does

**Pressurize** is a powerful yet easy-to-use tool for engineers to simulate how gas flows into a pressure vessel. It helps you understand what happens when you open a valve to fill a tank, answering questions like:

- How long will it take to reach a certain pressure?
- What is the maximum flow rate?
- Is the valve sized correctly?

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Analyze Pressure Vessel Filling

Simulate the entire process of filling a gas storage vessel. You can see how the pressure inside the vessel rises over time and how the temperature changes.

### 2. Select the Right Valve

Test different valve types and sizes to see how they perform. You can define how the valve opens (e.g., quickly or slowly) and see how that affects the filling process.

### 3. Ensure Safety

By accurately predicting pressure rise rates and peak flow conditions, you can ensure your system design is safe and within operating limits.

### 4. Work with Different Gases

The simulator isn't limited to just air. You can define complex gas mixtures (like Natural Gas, Hydrogen, CO2) and the tool will handle the complicated physics for you.

## Intended Users

- **Process Engineers** designing gas systems.
- **Mechanical Engineers** selecting valves and vessels.
- **Safety Analysts** verifying system safety.
